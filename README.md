# Note Taker

## Description
This is a note taking app where the user is able to write, save and delete notes. Upon entering the page the user's saved notes will be on the left side and an empty field on the right to enter in new notes. This application uses Express.js in the back end that retrives data from a JSON file. I learned about Express.js and using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
